Description:
 I am a dedicated and skilled professional with expertise in Python development, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and web technologies. Currently pursuing a BS in Data Science & Applications from IIT Madras, I have completed internships at Indian Railways and Orinson Technologies, gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development and automation. With a strong background in chemical engineering and programming, I have worked on projects involving distillation calculations, API development, and user authentication systems. Additionally, I hold multiple certifications from IIT Madras and have been actively involved in leadership roles, including serving as the Student Secretary of the Hobby Sub Council. My passion for technology and problem-solving makes me a valuable asset in any technical or research-driven environment.
